/** P3.2 - Dominoes 
 
Algorithm:
1.  Create one "random" domino, d1 
    (NOTE: a random domino has two ends 0-6, and each end is chosen at random)
2.  Create another "random" domino, d2
3.  Print both dominos, and information about each, like this:
        Domino #1: [6| ] Has Same Ends=false, Has Blank End=true,  Total=6
        Domino #2: [4|4] Has Same Ends=true,  Has Blank End=false, Total=8
4.  If d1 is the same as d2
4.1     print "The dominoes are the SAME"
4.2 Else
4.3     print "The dominoes are NOT THE SAME"

Each time the program is run two different dominoes should be selected at 
random and therefore the output will be different.
